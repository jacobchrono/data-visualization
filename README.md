I used plotly to create the submissions for: (Easy) Build a visualization that visualizes the annual pattern of entries into the HMIS. The product is html\better_line_chart.html. I took a snip as well and saved it in the graphs folder

For (Easy) Build a visualization that illustrates the patterns in purchases by time of day for both the Front Street and Central locations. I made way to many graphs. I just used matlibplot and loops. I did discover several interseting characteristics of the data. There are some hours with negative sales. Also, there are some transactions outside of normal business hours. To make the vistualization consistent and simple, I did some filtering and included only two of the locations for a limited set of hours. I want to add the overall title "Similar Weekend Business Patterns Across Locations" but neither ChatGPT o I could figure it out at the time of the writing.
